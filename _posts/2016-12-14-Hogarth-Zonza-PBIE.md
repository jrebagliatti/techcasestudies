Hogarth, a marketing implementation agency, found that a growing requirement of its customers was to have more information and insights about the assets they store on Zonza, a digital asset management platform that Hogarth provides. 

Because Hogarth has a typical ISV engagement model, Power BI Embedded seemed like the perfect solution for embedding data insights into the application it currently provides its customers. At a hackathon with Hogarth, we designed an architecture and implemented a solution by which Hogarth produces Power BI (PBIX) reports for a customer's data, connects them via direct query to an Azure SQL Database, and pushes the PBIX files into the cloud in a Power BI Embedded workspace collection. 

Inside their Python application, we used the Power BI Embedded REST APIs to create a JSON Web Token (JWT) and embed an IFRAME that displays the Power BI reports inside an **Insights** tab in their Zonza application.

## Customer profile ##

[Hogarth Worldwide (WPP)](www.hogarthww.com) is a marketing implementation agency that produces advertising and other marketing communications for clients across all media and languages. Its production expertise coupled with a powerful workflow and asset management technology delivers quality, control, and savings for global brands.

Hogarth believes that the production, adaptation, and supply of advertising materials is a specialist activity that should be carried out by a company that focuses solely on this discipline. It works alongside creative and media agencies to deliver advertising into markets efficiently and cost effectively—with quality enhanced and with all language and cultural challenges managed by experts. 

### Company location ###

Hogarth has offices all over the world ([list of worldwide offices](http://www.us.hogarthww.com/contact-us/contact-us-contact-us/)). However, on this project we worked with a team in the London GPS offices, Soho, London, UK.

### Enterprise digital asset management: Zonza application ###

**URL: [http://www.us.hogarthww.com/technology/technology-enterprise-asset-management/](http://www.us.hogarthww.com/technology/technology-enterprise-asset-management/)**

Zonza is an enterprise digital asset management (DAM) product created by Hogarth for its customers, mostly global brands, to store and distribute their marketing content. The content Zonza stores is immensely valuable. By storing the high-resolution assets of the master materials created for global campaigns and making it available to anyone with secure access, Zonza helps drive the cost of production down for Hogarth’s customers. 

## Problem statement 

Zonza has a typical ISV engagement model with its clients where they can use the SaaS solution and customers can upload, download, share, and tag assets with metadata.

A growing requirement for Hogarth’s customers was to have more information and insights about the assets they store on Zonza. For example, a real pain point is the use of rights-expired media. Brands have a period of time that assets can be displayed before the usage rights license expires. Brands may be fined if they publish content that is unlicensed or expired. By making these insights accessible to customers, Zonza can truly help solve that problem.

## Solution, steps, and delivery 

### What we worked on and what problems this helped solve 

The main aim of this experience was to take one of Hogarth's customer datasets and be able to embed a report into its Zonza application using Power BI Embedded. The application is written in Python, so the obvious choice was to use the REST APIs for Power BI Embedded instead of the SDKs. The APIs were used to create a Python token service (JWT creation) and then pass on that token to a workspace collection in Azure to call a PBIX file and display it in an **Insights** tab of their application. This is a great showcase of using the REST APIs to embed reports into any application, no matter the programming language.

The PBIX file contained a report displaying visuals to the user, leading them to understand/investigate information about their asset data held within the data management system. The main data point to solve the problem stated above is to show when assets might be about to expire.

We also explored the Power BI JavaScript APIs for interaction in and out of the IFRAME in the Zonza application. This will allow the customer to filter the report down to a few items and then be able to click them, receive the JSON request back from the _dataSelected_ event, and push this information to their database and retrieve the URL for the chosen asset. Once selected, the user will be taken to the page in the application containing that asset to investigate further. Unfortunately, we ran into an issue where an item in a table cannot be selected and an event returned from the API. However, we created an example of retrieving data from a bar chart in a sample application to show the possibilities.

Also during the project we created a set of web service HTTP requests in Python that will programmatically take care of the setup and requests of the Power BI Embedded service. This will be called from not only the customer application but also the team focused on the 'Admin Power User' who will want to create and upload PBIX files they have created in Power BI Desktop to be displayed in the end user application. All the REST calls were made in Python using the Power BI Embedded REST APIs.

### The data pipeline/overall architecture 

The data architecture below shows not only the Power BI Embedded service and the front-end application but the whole data cycle from exporting the Zonza application data to an Azure SQL Database through to calling the Python REST functions in customer and admin cases.

During the hackathon, we started with a CSV file that was an extract of the data contained in Zonza. Python code was written that inserted the data into the Azure SQL database and then the PBI report was built over that data source. The first iteration of the SQL schema had all the datatypes as varchar/char so we decided to change this to have the correct data types in the Azure SQL database, as doing a direct query connection from Power BI doesn’t allow us to change the datatypes. An import of data allows us to change datatypes in order to create the expected visuals, but a data refresh is needed.

Looking at future steps, there was conversation around options for loading the data to improve the throughput, as currently reloading the data into the new schema can take some time.

__Customer journey through architecture:__

1. Customer logs on to Zonza application with Zonza credentials.
2. Customer clicks on the **Insights** tab.
3. This makes a request to the Python Token Service to generate a JWT (JSON Web Token).
4. Once created, the JWT is passed to a Power BI Embedded service in Azure where the token is accepted/declined.
5. If accepted, the PBIX file uploaded to the Power BI Embedded workspace is displayed in the Zonza application **Insights** tab.
6. The data contained in the report displayed in Zonza is always up to date, as Direct Query functionality to an Azure SQL Database is set up through the REST APIs.

__Admin super user journey through architecture:__

1. Log on to the Zonza Admin application.
2. Upload a new PBIX file via a form upload.
3. Upload calls into Python functions, created to programmatically call the REST APIs and create/upload the (binary) PBIX file to a selected Power BI Embedded workspace collection/workspace.

### Technical details of implementation 

* PBIX files created to show the capabilities of cross filtering and charting visuals over tables.
* Power BI Embedded REST APIs were used to create a Python Token Service and Python Admin function calls. 
    * A JWT is created in the token service that completes the secure handshake with Azure Power BI Embedded service.
   
```Python
import time

import jwt


# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/power-bi-embedded/power-bi-embedded-app-token-flow
def generate_token(access_key, workspace_id, report_id, workspace_collection):
    """Generate JWT token."""
    # token times
    start = time.time()
    end = start + 60 * 60

    # create tokens
    headers = {
        "typ": "JWT",
        "alg": "HS256",
    }

    payload = {
        "wid": workspace_id,
        "rid": report_id,
        "wcn": workspace_collection,
        "iss": "PowerBISDK",
        "ver": "0.2.0",
        "aud": "https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api",
        "nbf": start,
        "exp": end,
    }

    return jwt.encode(key=access_key, headers=headers, payload=payload)

```

* REST functions to add/edit/delete and update settings/functionality in the Power BI Embedded workspace collection—used mainly within the admin application.
  ![Sample Python Code for Power BI Embedded REST Implementation]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-12-14-Hogarth-Zonza-PBIE/pbie_rest.PNG)
    
* First step was to complete a manual run-through of creation of the Power BI Embedded workspace collection/workspaces/PBIX upload and token generation to display a sample report in a POC application.
  ![Power BI Embedded Azure Portal UI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-12-14-Hogarth-Zonza-PBIE/azureportal_pbie.PNG)
    
* Set up the use of Direct Query with Azure SQL DB—updating the credentials for the report datasource so data can be displayed. This used the Power BI Embedded REST API functionality.

```Python
class Gateway(object):
    def __init__(self, import_, gateway_id, datasource_id):
        self.import_ = import_
        self.gateway_id = gateway_id
        self.datasource_id = datasource_id
        self.session = import_.session
        path = 'gateways/{}/datasources/{}'.format(
            gateway_id,
            datasource_id)
        self.url = urljoin(import_.workspace.url, path)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Gateway(import_={!r}, gateway_id={!r}, datasource_id={!r})'.format(
            self.import_, self.gateway_id, self.datasource_id)

    def update_connection_string(self, username, password):
        db_creds = {
            "credentialType": "Basic",
            "basicCredentials": {
                "username": username,
                "password": password,
            }
        }
        res = self.session.patch(self.url, json=db_creds)
        log_http('PATCH', self.url, res)
        res.raise_for_status()

```

* Created an **Insights** tab in a dev instance of Hogarth's application (Zonza) and embedded a report in an IFRAME.
* Experimented with the JavaScript APIs for Power BI Embedded and the events recorded; for example, using the _dataSelected_ functionality in JavaScript to retrieve JSON values about what visual has been selected and the data contained.
  * A brilliant [demo of the JavaScript APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/demo/code-demo/index.html#) from the Power BI Embedded team. This resource helped the team experiment quickly with the possible capabilities.
 
### Learnings from the Microsoft and Hogarth team 

* By walking through, in detail, the creation of tokens and embedding of the reports through the REST API sample, it was easier to understand the flow of the system and all steps that need to be completed. This is compared to the SDK, which does a lot of functionality for you.
* The architecture decisions around where to split into workspace collections or workspaces for customers were domain/customer-specific. This can depend on global regions needed, customer data segmentation, and multitenancy.

__Feedback/further investigation:__

The Microsoft and Hogarth team found feedback that has been provided back to the Power BI Embedded team, as well as areas for further investigation, such as the parity between REST APIs and SDK, as well as the abilities of the new JavaScript API for Event Operation _dataSelected_.

We also found when designing the solution that it would be useful to be able to set the display name of the workspace to something humanly readable, or send some JSON after creation to edit the display name of a workspace so that it is easier to reference from the admin site when needed.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, the two-day hackathon was a success. We achieved our goal of embedding a Power BI report into the Hogarth Zonza application using a JWT, as well as so much more around the programmatic access to resources using the Power BI Embedded REST APIs and interaction in and out of the report using the new JavaScript Embedded APIs.

The whole team gained valuable knowledge about Power BI Embedded and wider Azure services and this should allow Hogarth to continue this project into production.
