Agatsa has developed a small electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor called Sanket that is generating interest because of its potential use in remote locations, among other uses. Microsoft teamed up with Agatsa in an IoT hackfest to build a cloud back-end service that can work with Sanket. This report describes the solution. 
 
## Customer ##

[Agatsa](http://2016.agatsa.com/agatsa/home/) is a startup based in India that is building affordable medical devices and developing an ecosystem of care that will help people make informed decisions about their health. It currently has 10 employees, including its two cofounders. 

Agatsa has developed “Sanket”—a credit card-sized ECG monitor. The device can be held between the thumbs for 15 seconds to get a clinical-grade ECG. No lead or gel is required. Sanket has a corresponding app on Android and iOS. The app displays and records the ECG sent to it via a Bluetooth-based Sanket device.

### Commercial applications

Sanket is being reviewed by a major oil company in India and by Security Forces of India for use in remote locations such as Ladakh because the device doesn’t need a specific power input (works on a small battery) and it even works without Internet connectivity. 
Security Forces can now profile the soldiers serving in remote locations, with basic tools like Agatsa and weight-monitoring devices.

Most of the data collection drives and UAT drives have been done in medical institutions such as Fortis healthcare, Medanta Medicity, and multiple government hospitals in the National Capital Region.

This is the team that was involved with the project:

- Brijraj Singh – Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft, DX India
- Surbhi Jain – Audience Marketing, Microsoft, DX India
- Saurabh Kirtani – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft, DX India
- Pranav Sah – iOS Developer, Agatsa
- Akashdeep – Android Developer, Agatsa
- Abhinav Chaudhary – NodeJS Developer, Agatsa
- Rahul Rastogi – Founder, Agatsa
 
## Pain points ##

Agatsa is an electronic device company and their focus for the past few years was on developing Sanket and bringing accuracy to their algorithms. 

Sanket is a custom device that records minute vibrations of heartbeats via the patient’s thumbs and generates an electric signal that is sent to an Android/iOS app using Bluetooth. The mobile app records these electronic signals and sends them to a function in the cloud (currently a Python code running in Heroku), which converts this signal to an understandable pattern of ECG. 

The data collection and aggregation strategy was missing in the implementation. They have a Parse-based implementation on which they store customer profiles and the PDF files of ECGs. While the raw data that produces the ECG is not stored anywhere, the PDF files generated on the phone app are uploaded in Parse. 

The current solution has a few challenges:

*	The raw data from which the ECG is deduced is discarded, and isn’t kept anywhere.
*	Since raw data is not pushed to the cloud, further analytics are not possible on the cloud—especially for historical review or predictive analysis. 
*	Apart from customer profiles, no other information related to the devices is available on the server side for further processing. 
*	There are no means to find out how many devices have been active since what time and how many ECGs have been taken with them.
*	The information about ECG files is in Parse but no reporting tools are available for the same. 
*	Parse is being discontinued by Facebook and Agatsa wants a more scalable platform on which to store data that can easily be used for analytics and reporting tools and can be fed to machine learning systems in the future.

Agatsa envisions a platform over which ECG data and other vitals like body temperature, blood pressure, weight, and height can be captured and analyzed for preventive care. Agatsa also wants to connect patients to doctors and hospitals based on their medical conditions and help patients make informed decisions on the basis of analysis over various parameters.
 
## Solution ##

**Step 1: Evaluating ECG device capabilities**

Sanket is a custom device that currently has only Bluetooth capabilities and thus it can only communicate with a Bluetooth-enabled device (Android and iOS mobile phones). An ECG data packet is about 90 KB in size with all 8-12 lead worth of data. The user needs to hold the device in his/her hand for up to 15 seconds to get the ECG. The data packet of ECG is sent in one go to cloud after the data of all leads is collected.

**Step 2: Determining Hub device connectivity to the cloud**

The biggest hurdle we faced was the iOS device connectivity to Azure IoT Hub. Since there is no IoT Hub SDK for iOS, we had to create a REST API wrapper (written in NodeJS) that the iOS device can connect to for creating device identities and sending device-to-cloud messages.   

**Step 3: Building the end-to-end flow**

Once we were able to make both Android and iOS devices talk to Azure IoT Hub, we created the simple IoT Hub-based back end as shown in the next diagram.

*Figure 2. Data insertion architecture*

![Data insertion architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/agatsa/Sanket1.png)


We realized there is a pressing need to do push notifications over devices to support scenarios of patients sharing their vital stats with doctors for review and hence we started using Azure Notification Hubs. We also dropped the Azure Active Directory implementation for now but we'll certainly take it up in the future to support patient and doctors authentication and authorization.

*Figure 3. Final architecture*

**Step 4: Configuring IoT Hub, API app, and Stream Analytics**

We started writing code for both Android and iOS devices and started sending data to IoT Hub in a generic format for both devices. We also created a Stream Analytics job, which can do calculations over the ECG data (if there is ECG data in it), and store it in an Azure SQL Database table. The rest of the vitals such as temperature and blood pressure are stored as it is. 

Following is the sample request call from the iOS device.

**Sample JSON Message Packet from device to the Azure IoT Hub**


    {
    "data":{
    "uid":4632746732,
    "Vitals":[
               {
                 "vital":"ECG",
                 "metric":"Lead1",
                 "values":[142,165,167,198],
                 "timestamp":1478178407
               },
              {
                "vital":"Height",
                "metric":"inches",
                "values":[68],
                "timestamp":1478178532
             }
    ],
    "deviceid":47324
    }
    }



The NodeJS-based web API has two functions—one to generate the authentication token for each device and the other to send the data to the IoT Hub using the authentication token. Every time the device boots, it sends an initial message to the IoT Hub to check token validity. If the token is expired, it will generate a new token valid for 10 days.
The DeviceID is formatted with both the Bluetooth ID of the device and the iOS/Android device ID, like `<bluetoothid>-<mobiledeviceid>`

### Stream Analytics ###

When a message enters Azure IoT Hub, one Stream Analytics casts the data to appropriate data types while another Stream Analytics job works on the RAW ECG data and converts it into a usable format and stores it in the Azure SQL Database. Later the data can be archived into the blob storage on the basis of expiration policy.
(The Stream Analytics jobs couldn't be shared because they have IP algorithm to process the Raw ECG data.)

**Step 5. Sharing the reports with doctors**

Agatsa is using the Notification Hub to register multiple devices against every user (doctors or patients) and allow the patients to share the ECG reports with doctors. The shared message will have deep-linking links with parameters that would in turn open a Power BI Embedded report in a web control in mobile app (the Power BI Embedded work is in progress).

## Architecture ##

The schema of the solution architecture is explained above.

## Device used and code artifacts ##

- Sanket ECG device – Each Sanket device has a built-in token that, when paired with the Sanket app, can help decode the ECG data stream emitted by the Sanket device.
Users can access the ECGs taken by themselves only or shared to them by the owner of that ECG only. The ECG is not a PDF file anymore.  Rather, it's rendered on the fly by the device as well as the web app (web app in progress). 
- Android and iOS devices  
- GitHub repo for iOS connectivity to IoT Hub – [https://github.com/brijrajsingh/IOS-IOTHUb](https://github.com/brijrajsingh/IOS-IOTHUb) 

## Opportunities going forward ##

We will continue to work with Agatsa as we are expecting the iOS SDK for IoT Hub in few months. Once it is available, we'll get the code refactored and depend completely on the SDK, and enjoy the cloud-to-device messaging capabilities. Agatsa is also working over a Wi-Fi-enabled device for which we'll help implement a C-based version of an IoT Hub implementation.

On the cloud side, Agatsa is able to prepare different kinds of reports from the data in Azure SQL Database. They have also started working with Power BI Embedded reports. We'll continue the engagement to support these efforts. 

## Conclusion 

The Microsoft and Agatsa teams worked in tandem to enable cloud capabilities for the Sanket device. The new compute and data storage capabilities of the cloud would enhance the solution to use advanced analytics. We were able to iron out issues like iOS connectivity quickly with the use of IoT Hub REST API. The Agatsa team was quick to learn Stream Analytics and Azure IoT Hub.

The Agatsa team is happy to see the ease of deployment and integration with PaaS services. During the course of the hackfest, we also learned how their device works and how they have developed a very fine-tuned algorithm to prepare a 12-lead ECG from just the two sensors on the Sanket device. It was really cool to see how the data can even determine whether the patient is under stress or relaxed.

A quote from the Agatsa dev team:

>"Choosing Azure IoT Hub was easily the best decision that we have made for Sanket. It allows us to securely connect our devices with cloud back ends. Being in healthcare sector security is paramount. As a mobile dev-centric team, we wouldn't have thought it could be so much easier to send events over to the cloud and get them to the database with such ease. Earlier, it would have taken weeks for a dev to write APIs and send data to the cloud—now it's just a matter of hours to set up everything and start sending the data. Not only that, Azure has a set of other tools such as Power BI, Stream Analytics, among others, that can be connected with Azure IoT Hub with minimum fuss, yielding maximum results. Now using Microsoft tech, the Sanket platform can have concurrently thousands of users, getting their ECG monitored in milliseconds."
