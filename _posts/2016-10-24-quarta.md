Microsoft joined Quarta Technologies and TechnoKom in a hackfest to develop the IoT gateway for a TechnoKom solution, used as the transport layer for iQFreeze.

In this report, we describe the process and what we did before and during the hackfest, including:

-   How we created a base prototype of software as a service (SaaS)-ready architecture for the iQFreeze solution.
-   How to achieve a working prototype of a SaaS-ready IoT solution within a few hours using IoT Hub and Azure.
-   Learnings and architecture questions from the process.

## Customer profile ##

Quarta Technologies is a Moscow-based solution provider for emerging and innovation projects. It was established in 1997 and became a Windows Embedded distributor in 2004. It drives Windows Embedded in the Russian market and also organizes an annual Windows Embedded Day
conference in Russia with attendees from local and global IoT markets.

[Technokom Corporate Group](http://tk-nav.com/) has grown from a
small production company to a major supplier of fleet management solutions
hardware and software. The Russia-based business has a strong
market presence in products and applications.

The iQFreeze solution collects, processes, and transmits information about
the condition of the cargo and refrigeration units in real time using
the TechnoKom AutoGRAPH fleet management system hardware as the source
of data and transport to data servers. It was introduced to the market in May 2016. 

At the time of the hackfest, it was a classic client-server based product
with analytics with a high cost of scaling. The idea behind the project was to
propose and test a platform as a service (PaaS)-based architecture for the solution to finally
create a SaaS-ready solution for a simple, low-cost way to solve the scale
problem and provide a new way to market and sell the product.

## The hack team ##

The hack team consisted of two groups:

- **Development** 
	-   Two TechnoKom developers
	-   Alex Belotserkovskiy, Microsoft, Technical Evangelist
- **Business and planning** 
	-   Kirill Konyagin, Quarta, Director of Business Development
	-   Victor Kiselev, Microsoft, Partner Business Evangelist

An IoT hackfest can be a challenge because it usually involves not only
software, but hardware-related questions, and it can be difficult to simulate a real environment. Proper preparation eases the challenge, and therefore we had a lot of
discussions during the month before the hackfest. To understand
the context, here are some of the important questions and answers that were raised.

**Question:** Is the system already working? What is the state of the devices? What are they capable of? What are they not capable of?    
**Answer:** The system is not new, it has been functional for years. Because the system is intended for use with vehicles from different manufacturers/partners, 
the hardware is different as well. Almost all of the devices are alike in one detail—changing the firmware even on a small portion of these devices is not possible 
because they are already in the production. It prevents using a field gateway and/or IoT Client.

**Question:** What is the protocol the devices use to communicate with the current back end?  
**Answer:** TechnoKom implemented their own binary protocol. Any change to the current state will break current systems.                 

**Question:** Is it possible to implement a new back end that will work without breaking changes to the current system, and change the workflow to the new version?           
**Answer:** It is a challenge, but still possible. It will involve a thorough testing and should be out of scope of such a short activity as a hackfest.

**Question:** Is there a need to control devices remotely?    
**Answer:** Not at the moment.

We decided to increase the hackfest scope by adding the IoT gateway and data
processing pipeline. In short, it meant we had to break down the
current monolithic application into a more microservice-oriented
architecture, scalable and PaaS-based. Because we had the real data stream
from AutoGRAPH, we removed all of the device-related questions as
well.

Instead of one server with the Win32 application, we decided to use
cloud hosting for the IoT Protocol Gateway that listens to the TCP
connections and forwards data to the data pipeline (IoT Hub =&gt; Azure
Stream Analytics =&gt; Storage, Machine Learning and SQL Azure)—in five hours.

## Problem statement ##

We had five hours and three developers to build a working prototype of a SaaS-ready IoT solution using IoT Hub and Azure. Our six tasks:

-   Assess the original architecture and propose a new base Azure PaaS-based architecture.
-   Implement the test gateway (console app) as a proof of concept.
-   Assess the possible options to implement it as the cloud gateway (for example, to use Azure IoT Gateway, or Cloud Services, and so on).
-   Migrate the gateway to the cloud.
-   Develop the code to connect the gateway with the data pipeline.
-   Equip the prototype with the monitoring suite (Application Insights).

First, we discussed how to decouple the monolithic approach into the
PaaS-based architecture that was implemented long ago for the solution.

## Architecture before ##

The old architecture was the classical two-tier architecture
"client-server" with C++ built as a monolithic application running
in the Windows Server environment. The server job is to receive data
packets from the monitoring system devices installed on vehicles and
save the received data in the local store, as well as be the front end
for external customers who want access to the data. The code has a
modular structure at the level of source code files—network
communication module, file storage, data decoding, and the database
module.

Data between the server and the onboard devices is transferred
(generally over mobile comm channels) using the proprietary binary TCP
protocol (without the use of application layer protocols). The client
starts with the handshake packet and the server should answer with the ACK
packet.

*Figure 2. Architecture - before*

The server software uses a set of system calls Win32API. Data is
stored in the binary form, and each connected device has its own separate
file. Data is being stored without any modification. External
customers access data using the special client software.

One challenge with such architecture is that there is no way to scale
it in a faster way than to install a new server, set the load
balancing up, and so on.

We took our time to prototype the architecture that would provide
the same functionality, in a scalable and agile way.

## Architecture after ##

During the hackfest we noticed there was no need for the old
application anymore. It served the gateway function, saved data
without modification, and some extra tasks. We decided to replace that
application with Azure service. We considered a few options,
including [Azure IoT
Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-protocol-gateway/)
and a custom-made gateway. In the end, we decided to
implement the custom-made gateway and host it on Azure Cloud Services.

*Figure 3. Architecture - after*

![Fig. 3. Architecture - after]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/quarta-3.png)


A Cloud Services-hosted gateway should function the same as
the Win32 app in the old architecture, but in a more scalable and agile way because
it is hosted behind the load balancer and it is simple and fast
to scale it, even automatically. The gateway forwards data to the IoT
Hub that is connected to Stream Analytics, which sends data to Azure
Storage, Machine Learning, and a SQL database.

Azure Services allowed us to implement the cloud architecture and make the legacy Win32 application more cloud-friendly, highly available, and scalable. In a few hours we were able to decouple the complex monolithic application.

The original architecture was almost completely changed.

## Development ##

We started the development process by implementing the on-premises
version of the gateway. It is important to start with a small step and
not do everything in the cloud immediately. The cloud has its benefits,
but if you develop something new, there are some nuances that can make
the prototyping more difficult—like setting the endpoints,
troubleshooting a remote project, and deploying and re-deploying the solution, which can
take up to 10 minutes each time.

We divided the task of implementing the IoT gateway into subtasks:

-   Gateway listens to the TCP port.
-   Gateway establishes the connection with the device.
-   Gateway gets the stream from the device.
-   Gateway sends the ACK packet back.
-   Gateway parses the protocol.
-   Gateway sends data to the IoT Hub.

Although nothing is new or innovative in
implementing a TCP server and sending the ACK packet back, we had one
issue with the local gateway. Taking into account that we were in
a Microsoft office, the network perimeter could
make the testing more difficult. We could not manage the network
perimeter in the office, but we could in the cloud, so we wanted to avoid
any settings that would not be needed in the final solution.

What did we do? We used **ngrok**!

[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a nice project that provides a
way to implement secure tunnels to the localhost.

We downloaded ngrok, registered the account (needed for TCP
tunnels), and everything started to work. Just work! We got the stream
and were able to send the ACK packet back with only one command.

*Figure 4. Ngrok command line interface is really simple*

While developing, we had two additional steps—writing to the local
storage and getting the Endpoint and the Port when deployed in the
cloud. Because Cloud Services has its own storage and addressing
models, we decided to go a little deeper with that.

## Writing to the Cloud Services local storage ##

Of course, Azure has better ways to persist data, but the original
architecture stores data locally, so we decided at least to test it. By
default, everything that Cloud Services is using (*derived
from [*RoleEntryPoint
class*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.serviceruntime.roleentrypoint_members.aspx)) *will
not have permission to write to the file system. No way to write to
"C:/temp" or "d:/Program Files/MyCoolStorage". To be able to do
that, you should set the special local storage area first and use
Azure API to write to disk in the Cloud Services role. You will need
to [*configure some space in Local
Storage*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee758708.aspx) from
your **ServiceDefinition.csdef** by giving that space a name, a size,
and setting if the data should survive basic role recycles
(cleanOnRoleRecycle setting). One minus: **cleanOnRoleRecycle** does
not guarantee your data will survive.

We had some spare time to test it, and it worked. The code is
pretty simple.

<pre>const string azureLocalResourceNameFromServiceDefinition = "LocalStorage1";

var azureLocalResource = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource(azureLocalResourceNameFromServiceDefinition);

var filepath = azureLocalResource.RootPath + "telemetry.txt";

Byte[] bytes = new Byte[514];
String data = null;

while (true)
{
	TcpClient client = server.AcceptTcpClient();
	data = null;
	int i;
	NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();
		
	while ((i = stream.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length)) != 0)
	{
 		…
	 	System.IO.File.AppendAllText(filepath, BitConverter.ToString(bytes));
	 	…
 	}
 	
	client.Close();
 }
</pre>

Data persisted through the recycling, so it may be a good way to store
some temporary data.

## Getting Endpoint and Port for listener ##

Taking into account the dynamic nature of Cloud Services (and
almost everything in the cloud), it may be a bad idea to just say, "hey,
listen to the 127.0.0.1".

Cloud Services has its own methods to get the Endpoint defined.
First, you need to define the Endpoint in the CS settings.

*Figure 5. Configuration of Cloud Services Local Storage area*

![Configuration of Cloud Services Local Storage area]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/quarta-5.png)


<pre>IPEndPoint instEndpoint = RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance.InstanceEndpoints\["TCPEndpoint"\].IPEndpoint;
IPAddress localAddr = IPAddress.Parse(instEndpoint.Address.ToString());
TcpListener server = new TcpListener(localAddr, instEndpoint.Port);</pre>

Now, even if we scale the CS, it will work and listen to the needed
TCP port and Endpoint. Load Balancer will distribute the requests, so
it is quite important in our case. Also important is that
our scenario is stateless, so Cloud Services is a perfect candidate for
implementation.

We discussed the use of Service Fabric, but the timing was tight so we went with CS instead.

We made the local gateway work. Now it was time to deploy it into the cloud. The Visual Studio tooling for Azure is tightly integrated with Azure, and the deployment process is clear and simple.

Published and working!

The few issues we had were successfully solved by setting up the Remote
Desktop and Application Insights.

We had no issues with forwarding messages to the IoT Hub and Stream
Analytics and just used the official code samples.

## Conclusion ##

When we planned our IoT hackfest, we worried that
a single day would not be enough for developing something that really worked,
especially in a situation with such a challenging environment and
requirements (a lot of legacy devices, proprietary TCP/IP protocol,
partner dev team that came from another area just for the hackathon,
and, of course, the core monolithic Win32 application written in C++).

What we learned is that PaaS is really a great way to:

- Prototype the solution. 
- Make it scalable and agile from the very beginning. 
- Learn new things. 

In a short time, we were able to
prototype an end-to-end IoT solution using real data.

In one day, we achieved everything that we agreed on as a target, and
were ready to go further. Our big bet was to make the monolithic Win32
application loosely coupled, and, at the end of the day, get rid of
the monolithic approach and go with one that uses more microservices and is more agile.
Now we are sure that the solution is scalable and it can be
done with very few actions. And that is a great outcome!

What is great as well is that the hackfest is not just a development
event where geeks from two companies have some fun with code, it
is a great time to communicate and go through the issues together—talk, learn, and share the experience.

We are grateful to the TechnoKom and Quarta teams for many reasons:

- They were eager to rearchitect the solution and make it more
    cloud-friendly.
- There was a lot of discussion on how to improve both their solutions and
    Microsoft—we were able to gather some technical feedback.
- Their spirit is awesome.

The solution is not completely ready for
production. What is important is that, in one day, we were able to
engage a lot of technical and business masterminds to create a
foundation for our further development—to test the solution with Azure Service Fabric, to migrate to AMQP or MQTT, to develop the
Machine Learning component and gather insights from the data. We
decided to "go and fail fast" and, as we learned, we did not fail in any
aspect.
